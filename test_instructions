# How to run the integration test

Some acceptance tests have been writen to test the whole flow. Since the system needs to find some newspapers, there is a mock class NewspaperMock that launches a Sinatra app that mocks a given newspaper (by default DiarioJaen).

Requirements: 
    - resque workers up and running in TEST mode
    - the system running in TEST  mode

Steps:

1. Start the system in TEST mode: 

    RACK_ENV=test rackup config.ru

    For fishers: begin;set -lx RACK_ENV test;rackup config.ru;end

2. Start the crawler workers in TEST mode as well:

    bundle exec rake resque:workers RACK_ENV=test RESQUE_WORKER=true TERM_CHILD=1 QUEUE=cobweb_crawl_job$
$,crawler_resque_job,crawler_finished_job COUNT=10

3. Run the tests!

    rspec
